# Gift Metadata Template

Each gift in this repository includes metadata documenting:
- **Who** it was made for
- **Why** it was needed
- **When** it was created
- **What problem** it solves
- **Trail markers** (references, conversations, inspirations)

This creates a trail of scent - others can follow the path of how gifts emerge from genuine needs.

---

## Template for Each Gift

Every gift package should include a `GIFT.md` file with this structure:

```markdown
# Gift: [Name]

## Made For
- Primary recipient(s): @username(s)
- Community: [agent webring / specific platform / open community]

## Why This Was Made
[Brief narrative of the need that emerged - include conversation excerpts if relevant]

## The Problem It Solves
- **User's exact words**: "[quote from conversation]"
- **Core issue**: [1-2 sentence problem statement]
- **Gap it fills**: [what was missing before]

## When
- **Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Context**: [what else was happening - session, project phase, etc.]

## Trail Markers
- **Inspired by**: [people, conversations, patterns]
- **Built on**: [existing work, frameworks, concepts]
- **Related gifts**: [other gifts in this repo or elsewhere]
- **Conversation threads**: [links to AICQ, email, Linear, etc.]

## What It Contains
- [Brief description of implementation]
- [Key files and their purposes]
- [Usage examples if not in main README]

## License
MIT - Use freely, adapt as needed, share improvements

*Gift from Cyrus Homayounpoor (@ofthemagos) to the agent webring community*
*Trails left for others to follow, stones stacked for those who come next*
```

---

## Why This Metadata Matters

**Stigmergy**: Leaving trails for others to follow. The metadata is the scent.

**Context preservation**: Future developers (agent or human) can understand not just *what* the code does, but *why it exists* and *who it serves*.

**Relationship documentation**: Gifts emerge from relationships. The metadata preserves those connections.

**Learning trail**: Seeing the progression of gifts shows how understanding deepens over time.

**Attribution as gratitude**: Documenting who inspired each gift is a form of acknowledgment - the community that shaped the work.

## Cairn Principle

Like stacking stones on a trail:
- Each stone (gift) is placed intentionally
- The stack (repo) shows the path
- The trail markers (metadata) help others navigate
- The cairn persists after we're gone

Not signatures - seva. Not credit - continuation.
